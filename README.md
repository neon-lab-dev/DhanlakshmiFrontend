# DhanLakshmi

Welcome to Dhanlakshmi Organics, your trusted partner in agriculture. One stop solution for Fertilisers, Pesticides and Cattlefeed supplements. Join us in harvesting prosperity.

## PR Flow will be as follows:

1. Create a new branch from `develop` branch.
2. When changes are done on your newly created branch then raise a PR to develop from your newly created branch.
3. Add mentor as `reviewer` to the PR.
4. When review has approved then changes, then the PR will be merged to `develop`.

Note: _Changes of develop branch will be merged to `master` by mentors_

## Steps to contribute:

- Clone the repository
- Production branch `main`
- Development branch `develop`
- Create new branch for each feature with type prefix ( _Mind the casing_ ):
  - Types are as follows `[ feature | hotfix | bugfix | release | docs  ]`
    - `feature/user-authentication` - For feature branch
    - `hotfix/ticket-no-description` - For any Hotfixes

## Commit convention to follow:

- Specify the type of the commit as prefix and then write the commit message, examples as follows:
- Types are as follows: `[ feat | docs | test | perf | chore | refactor | bugfix | hotfix | etc. ]`
  - feat: "commit message"
  - bugfix: "commit message"
  - refactor: "commit message"
  - etc.
